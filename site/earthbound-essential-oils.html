						<h2>The challenge</h2>
						<p><strong>The user problem: </strong>Product returns, misuse, and online session abandonment.</p>
						<p>Product returns and Customer Service calls revealed that customers misused essential and fragrance oil products that led to health concerns.
						Upon further discovery, store employees generally did not have enough product knowledge regarding the safety and practice of mixing oils to communicate to customers.</p>
						<p>An uninformed employee culture resulted in the miscategorization of these products online that led to confused and unhappy customers.</p>
						<p><strong>The solution:</strong> A dedicated landing page.</p>

						In the feedback session my teammate probed retrospectively while I asked final follow up questions and collected insights from video recordings and contributed insights. 
						<p>Although the test was meant to focus on our navigation menu, the results showed that 8 out of 9 participants failed to differentiate our fragrance oils, which are chemicals, and our natural essential oils.</p>

We hoped a simple categorization change in the nav would be enough to differentiate, but customers continued to call in asking how to use essential oils.

						<p><strong>Customer journey and education: </strong>In our second attempt we realized there was far more information to understand than a user would gain merely by changing our nav IA. An Essential Oils 101 landing page was the solution to group together related products as an unbrella in the navigation and to inform customers. It needed to be broad enough to give an overview of the product ecosytem and product-driven for shoppers to quickly find what they want.</p>

						<p>I used color labels to group like product together. I designed the labels to look familiar to the labels on the product packaging. Anchor links from the landing page to the scroll position of a label shortens the user's time from scrolling through many products as our inventory continues to grow.</p>
						<p>It wasn't financially viable to rebuild the template. Redesigning the template was outside the scope of the project. It was more efficient for me to create a custom block in the CMS system that looked like the existing template.</p>

						<h2>Compromises along the way...</h2>
						<p class="blockquote">Identifying and maintaining the product's truth through the development cycle was a wicked challenge.<span class="blockquote-owner">paraphrased from Devin Moore</span></p>
						<p>The original intent of this project was to give unknowledgable customers health, safety, and benefits information.</p>
						<p><strong>Carousels: </strong>Stakeholders wanted the landing page to be heavily product-driven. This changed our original context of the design from educational to marketing. The requirement to show a lot of product led me to extend a current carousel pattern on our site.</p>

						<h2>Impact</h2>
						<p>This was a great step forward in having information on our site to educate our customers.</p>
						<p><strong>A bigger beast than we realized: </strong>The impact of this project was underwhelming. We did not see a noticable increase in product 
						sales and we've found that product misinformation is spread far and wide amongst our store 
						employees.</p>
						<p><strong>A customer service resource: </strong>Customer service has reported less confusion from online shoppers and the landing page is used 
						as a resource for customer service. This has led me to believe that we need to address this 
						issue in more ways than just when a customer is shopping online.

						<h2>Learnings</h2>
						<p>If I got another shot at this project I would include redesigning product packaging and designing 
						informational visuals in store to make it more clear that fragrance and essential oils 
						are very different.
