						<h2>The challenge</h2>
						<p>Never before has Earthbound considered the need to inform their customers online about their Essential Oil product line. Customers would call Customer Service to ask questions about what they are and how to use them and the problems they had with oils. It got a little concerning to find out that customers were misusing oils that led to health concerns, and also product returns.
						</p>
						<p>Another problem arose from doing a casual survey of employees to find out how much they knew about the product line. It was surprising to discover even employees who were around the product line, whether they were selling it in stores or fulfilling orders did not have product knowledge.</p>
						<p>An uninformed employee culture resulted in the miscategorization of these products online that led to confused and unhappy customers.</p>
						<p>We used these insights from user feedback and analytics to help inform a new landing page.</p>

						<h2>Research and discovery</h2>
						<p><strong>A UX lab was born: </strong>It wasn't until I partnered with a team member to put together the first UX testing lab that we discovered just how profound the lack of knowledge about these products was from our employees (who were our testers).</p>
						<p>My partner and I created a test and procedure to conduct the interviews with nine employees.</p>
						<p>The test was meant to focus on our navigation menu. Our results showed that 8 out of 9 participants failed to differentiate our fragrance oils, which are chemicals, and our natural essential oils. After the feedback session on the test itself, we probed further about their knowledge of our oil lines.</p>
						<p><strong>Categorization challenge: </strong>Our first instinct was to separate fragrance from essential oils in the navigation menu. However, we intercepted more confusion about knowing which oils and accessories go together; fragrance oils can only be used with oil burners while essential oils can are used with diffusers. How could we tie together the right accessories with the right oils while keeping our categories from bloating?
						</p>
						<p><strong>Customer journey and education: </strong>An Essential Oils 101 landing page was the solution to group together related products in the navigation and to inform customers. It needed to be simple and product-driven for customers who lack product knowledge, but also the shortest journey for knowledgeable shoppers to jump quickly to find what they want.</p>

						<h2>Sketching wireframes</h2>
						<p>After researching how competitors inform their customers about Essential Oils, we gathered information from the product buyer and talked to the manufacturer about their products. I sketched out wireframes for the landing page, the product page, and the journey from our two primary access points: the homepage and the main navigation.</p>
						<p class="blockquote">Identifying and maintaining the product's truth through the development cycle was a wicked challenge.<span class="blockquote-owner">paraphrased from Devin Moore</span></p>
						
						<p>Stakeholders were concerned about liability; what we should claim to know about product safety and application. It was a challenge to find the right language and design that could help customers get a broad view of the facets of our oils and its accessories while also not being too explicit about safety concerns.</p>
						<p>I started planning the build while the designer branded the mockup, gathered images, and rough content from the content manager.</p>
						<p>Our initial goal was to get a basic version up and working so I could begin writing out user stories and prioritize them for development.</p>

						<h2>FAQs</h2>
						<p>The concern to inform, but to not be the authority on the safety of essential oils led to the use of FAQs. In this format, the information could be dry and resourceful. We took our research on the most commonly asked questions from social sites and from speaking directly with the leading distributor of essential oils, Wyndmere Naturals.</p>
						<p><strong>Reusing features: </strong>Rather than reinventing the wheel I applied an interactive accordion feature that I had already implemented to other pages of our site to keep our first deployment of a new initiative consistent and familiar.</p>

						<h2>Carousels</h2>
						<p>First and foremost this page is for shopping, which means we need to include products. Customers who are new to essential oils get exposure to various products through the carousels.</p>
						<p><strong>Extending features: </strong>I knew we could reuse a jQuery carousel plugin that was already in use in other parts of the site; however, I needed to extend the plugin. I created a plugin for my project that included the base functionality of the jQuery plugin, but that could be added to or changed through parameters. The carousel could stay DRY when extending it as a plain carousel, or a carousel with a view box, or a carousel with a view box and a zoom-in feature.</p>
