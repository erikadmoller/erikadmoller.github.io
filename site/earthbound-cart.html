						<h2>The challenge</h2>
						<p><strong>The user problem: </strong>Adding product to the cart was a 2-3 step process, and it removed the user's
						from their shopping flow.
						Understanding shipping options and troubleshooting promotional codes were confusing to users.</p>
						<p>Customer service reported issues, and this was validated by observing screen recordings.</p>
						<p><strong>The solution: </strong>Popup cart feature and page redesign without a software overhaul.</p>

						<p><strong>Add to cart test insights: </strong>Initially, our UX test was geared toward how users navigate our drop-down menu and add products to the cart. 
						In the feedback session, users complained about the way quantity editing functioned.</p>
						<p>Users also complained about how "annoying" it was to be taken out of their browsing flow whenever they added 
						a product to their cart.</p>
						<p>Making changes to their cart, applying promo codes, and estimating shipping was not part of the test.</p>
						</p>
						<p>When researching how competitors and modern eCommerce websites approach their add-product-to-cart flow, 
						I found they were clean, unassertive, and as short as possible.</p>
						<p><strong>Estimate shipping market research: </strong>After observing screen recordings and interviewing customer service, developers, and the eCommerce director, 
						I discovered a few required fields on the cart page were unnecessary to display what was essentially table shipping rates. 
						I concluded that users were confused when they applied promo codes because success and error messages
						were far from the input field.</p>

						<h2>Baby steps</h2>
						<p>I am currently in development on this project. To keep the project moving forward, 
						we broke it down into two iterations. The first is to brand and style the elements. 
						The second is to implement the removal of the gift card and zip code block. 
						Then I will implement the table shipping rates and error messages. 
						<p><strong>Teamwork: </strong>There are barriers prevent the second implementation from happening.
						The collaboration of technical work is a dance between myself and our Magento agency. The user stories
						that are dependent on their input and work are in their court currently.</p>
						<p>I have already deployed the first step in the cart and am in the middle of the second.</p>

						<h2>Learnings</h2>
						<p>Part of this project requires assistance from Earthbound's agency who are experts on Magento platforms.
						When it came to Magento specific changes, I learned how small design decisions could sometimes be surprisingly expensive 
						for the effort.
						</p>
						<p>Questioning everything was reinforced to me; just because a tactic is used doesn't mean 
						it's needed.</p>
