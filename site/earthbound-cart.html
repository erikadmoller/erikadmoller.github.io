						<h2>The challenge</h2>
						<p>The cart page had not been altered since the website was born 3 years ago. It was barely responsive and mobile was an unpleasant experience because the cart was originally built in tables. The increase in mobile traffic and abandoned carts on mobile led the team to rethink the cart from a UX perspective without sinking time and money into a complete software overhaul.</p>

						<h2>Research and discovery</h2>
						<p>When researching how competitors and modern eCommerce websites approached their cart page we found they were clean and intuitive.</p>
						<p>We liked a feature used by only one competitor we thought was a brilliant idea and would significantly improve our mobile experience. When a user was in the cart page on mobile the checkout button would stick to the bottom of the viewport while the rest of the page was scrollable. Our cart had several operations (add a gift card, add a promo code, estimate shipping) and we were concerned users would be frustrated with the amount of scrolling just to get to the checkout button.</p>
						<p>We noticed many competitors didn't have a gift card add/check on their cart pages. Most broke the two action into different places on their websites. Adding a gift card was applied in Checkout while checking a gift card was performed on a separate page linked to by a gift card category or footer link.</p>
						<p>In my technical research I discovered unneccessary input fields that were user required, but didn't add anything to the outcome.</p>
						<p>I also discovered a way to move error alerts from the top of the page down to their respective field.</p>

						<h2>Sketching wireframes</h2>
						<p>We scrapped the gift card section all together because it was an unneccessary step at this point in a user journey. I designed mobile first because it was the most technically inflexible. I had to find creative ways to make the sections responsive without changing most of the code itself.</p>
						<p>Once the sections were layed out responsively I worked with the graphic designer to brand our content. Buttons, spacing and typography needed to look consistent with other parts of the website.</p>

						<p>It felt good to remove a whole section that didn't need to be there. Speaking of originally we thought it would be good to change keyboards on number-only inputs on mobile to the dialpad. We thought this would really make a difference until I discovered our shipping rates were flat fees. This whole time there was never a reason to require a zipcode. This discovery was pure gold :)</p>

						<h2>Baby steps</h2>
						<p>We are currently in testing and development on this project. To keep the project moving forward we broke it down into two iterations. The first would be to brand the elements since that would be easy. The second will be to implement the logic and removal of gift card and zipcode block. I have already deployed the first step and am in the middle of the second.</p>
