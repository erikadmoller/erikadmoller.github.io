						<p>When researching how competitors and modern eCommerce websites approach their cart page,

						<p>After observing screen recordings and interviewing customer service, developers, and the eCommerce director, 
						I discovered a few required fields were unnecessary to display what was essentially table shipping rates. 
						I concluded that users were confused when they applied promo codes because success and error messages
						was not located close the input field.</p>

						<p>We scrapped the gift card section altogether because it was unnecessary in order for users to get a subtotal. 
						I designed mobile first because it was the most technically inflexible. I found creative ways to make the

						<p>Once the sections were laid out responsively, I worked with the graphic designer 
						to wireframe the desktop and make branding adjustments.</p>

						<h2>Baby steps</h2>
						<p>I are currently in development on this project. To keep the project moving forward, 
						we broke it down into two iterations. The first is to brand the elements. 
						The second is to implement the removal of the gift card and zip code block. 
						Then I will implement the table shipping rates and error messaging. 
						I have already deployed the first step and am in the middle of the second.</p>

						<h2>Learnings</h2>
						<p>Part of this project requires assistance from Earthbound's agency who are experts on Magento platforms.
						When it came to Magento specific changes I learned how small design decisions can sometimes be surprisingly expensive 
						for the effort.
						</p>
						<p>Questioning everything was reinforced to me; just because a tactic is currently used doesn't mean 
						its needed.</p>
