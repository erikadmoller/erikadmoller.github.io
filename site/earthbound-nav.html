						<h2>The challenge</h2>
						<p><strong>The user problem: </strong>When the site first launched three years ago, the menu navigation was deep.
							We found pageviews were extremely low on third and fourth tier page categories. 
							The navigation lacked responsiveness especially on mobile where so many visible categories made the nav too long.</p>
						<p><strong>The solution:</strong> A meganav.</p>

						<h2>Research and discovery</h2>
						<p><strong>UX lab discovery: </strong></p>
						<p class="role"><span class="highlight">Role:</span> Follow-up interviewer and recording analyst.<br>
							<span class="highlight">Methods:</span> Retrospective Probing, screen recordings and surveys.</p>
						<p>I partnered with a member from the eCommerce team to put together the first UX testing lab. My partner and I created a test, a procedure, and a report. The test focused on the usability of our navigation menu. 
						<p>Our results showed that a majority had trouble successfully finding products in their initial effort or gave up and used the search function.</p>
						<p><strong>Researching the competition: </strong>Some of our competitors continue to practice deep navigation, but others consistently embraced the mega nav. 
							The mega nav would meet our need to bring deep categories to the front. 
							By adopting this modern approach, new problems presented themselves.
						</p>
						<p><strong>Categoriztion issues: </strong>Our product range is wide. I was concerned about how to display like and unlike categories in a shared space. 
						</p>
						<p>My research presented the need for a rule to keep the first tier navigation consistent for users. 
							Research showed that inconsistent behavior of navigation menus led to user confusion, 
							therefore all first tier categories could not just be a link with no dropdown. I also wanted to reduce unpredictable technical bugs.</p>

						<h2>Sketching wireframes</h2>
						<p>After presenting initial sketches to stakeholders, there was push back on my rule to never to allow first tier navigation to change. 
							Stakeholders required unique campaigns to get the highest visibility.</p>
						<p>I compromised by making an exception to one dedicated menu that could change. As a developer, 
							I emphasized the importance of avoiding unexpected results.</p>
						<p><strong>All about context: </strong>We considered a primary user persona; who is deal-driven and thrifty, to keep 'Sale' a prevalent and accessible category.</p>
						<p class="role"><span class="highlight">Ideation #1: </span>Meganav with stacked related columns.<br>
							<span class="highlight">Ideation #2: </span>Include nav images.</p>
						<h2>Solutions to unchangeable processes.</h2>
						<p>Earthbound's business model is heavy on the use of promotionals and I knew despite what research says about not overdoing
							promos, this was not a battle I would ever win.
						</p>
						<p>I pitched the use of nav images to lighten areas on the site that are promo heavy. The homepage in particular is the main
							area to display promos. Using nav images to promote low pageview categories or special campaigns 
							was a welcomed solution from stakeholders.

						<p><strong>Desktop Strategy: </strong>I came up with a design system for CMS admins to follow that would keep the content organized. 
							Relevant content should be in the same column or side by side. Any second tier categories that have no children were to 
							go in the last content column or at the bottom of a relevant column.

						<p><strong>Mobile Strategy: </strong>Collapsing three tiers of menus was a challenge, but it was also standard practice amongst competitors.</p>
						<p>I used neutral background color variation to differentiate between second and third tier menus. Second or third tier categories with no children naturally did not have an expandable icon.</p>
						<p>To keep the header uncluttered I needed to move an icon somewhere else. After going through our analytics, I found that 'My Account' was the least likely path users took to enter their account. 
							Most of the time users entered their account through a form in the checkout process. The best possible place to move 'My Account' was within the nav menu.</p>

					<h2>Animation</h2>
					<p><strong>Desktop <i>hovers</i>: </strong>After consulting the design team about branding standards and testing a few interactions we decided to incorporate our brand standard blue as an underline.</p>
					<p>We tested several implementations from modifying active category text color to background colors, but it was inconsistent with other hover interactions across our site. We use brand blue in body text hovers; therefore it was inconsistent with how a drop-down menu performs as opposed to a link to another page.</p>
					<p>I added a .3s timer on the drop-down menu partly because most of our competitors have similar functionality, but also because it renders our site a little more sophisticated. I delayed the drop-down menu by .2s because in testing the nav would instantly open when users slowly moved their cursors over the nav with the intent of moving down the page.<p>
					<p><strong>Mobile <i>touch</i>: </strong>From researching our competition we knew slide out menus are prevalent on mobile and this strategy was right for us. The trouble we had is that our main navigation can change and it was a challenge to design with a fluctuating number of categories. When the menu initially opens by sliding in from the left, we use the slide down animations that you typically see with accordions. We adapted this animation from other places on our site with similar functionality.</p>

					<p><strong>What about search? </strong>From my standpoint, I knew the search menu would conflict with the nav menu. We had to decide which would overlay the other in the event a user opened both of them. What was more important? 
					<p>After digging in our analytics, it was apparent most users preferred search or ended up searching when they could not find what they wanted in the nav.</p>
					<p>Therefore, I decided to make the search the highest layer slides out from the right when active.</p>
